Costco web scrapping.

* What I will do is as below.
  - The code saves all items' lists in the what's new category in the costco website.
  - It includes the price and the sale price of the item and pictures and description of each item.
  - That's all.

* How to find Xpath? 
  - In google chrome, right click, inspect, mouse cursor click, move mouse cursor to the menu you want to find path, right click on the path, copy to xpath.
